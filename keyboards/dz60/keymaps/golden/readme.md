# Coffee House Layout

This is a basic keymap for the coffee house keyboard based on a DZ60 layout,
except the default and Fn layer are very similar to a POK3R.

The default layer is normal ANSI and the Fn layer has the other keys.

The Fn2 layer contains the RGB and backlight controls, which happen to be the
exact same key combinations as the default DZ60 layout.
